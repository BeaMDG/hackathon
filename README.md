Welcome to QUACKLY, a marketplace that we dive into fun and nostalgia with a unique collection of rubber ducks that will delight your heart. We are the perfect destination for all duck lovers and collectible enthusiasts, offering a wide variety of carefully curated rubber ducks, each with its own vibrant personality and irresistible charm.

<h2 align="center" class="key-features">About QUACKLY</h2>
QUACKLY was born from the idea that a rubber duck can be more than just a desk decoration for developers. Inspired by the famous "rubber duck debugging" technique, where explaining code aloud to a rubber duck helps find errors, we decided to take this practice to the next level. Each DuckCode rubber duck comes with a unique specialty and is equipped with features to aid problem-solving and boost coder productivity.
